GitHub pages are the best way to host static blogs like `Gatsby`. One of the most common ways to do this is, maintain your code in main/master branch, build it, and then push the code to `gh-pages` branch. There are various CI that easily automate this process like Travis CI, CircleCI, etc. With GitHub actions, this would be a piece of cake, and without depending on any third-party provider. From the docs:

> Automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository with GitHub Actions

Workflow

* * *

#### Prerequisites

1.  You have a static blog(let‚Äôs say gatsby) setup, the code for your blog is in master branch.
2.  You have a build script in your package.json
3.  You have setup your GitHub pages (or pointed to your custom domain) in `gh-pages` branch.

#### Process

**Step 1**

Install [gh-pages npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) in your project, this is a small utility package which helps to publish your code to gh-pages branch. You can skip this step in case you want to push all contents from master to `gh-pages` branch.

**Step 2**

Add a deploy script in your `package.json`. This script should do 2 jobs

1.  Build the project, make it ready for being published.
2.  Push the changes to the `gh-pages` branch.

For example, this pushes the code to `gh-pages` via npm package.

    "deploy": "gatsby build && gh-pages -d public -r https://$GH_TOKEN@github.com/<username>/<repository_name>.git"

**Step 3**

Generate an access token and add it to secret of your repository.

1.  Create an access token: goto [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens), create a new token, give it access for repo and workflow.

2.  Add this token to secret of your repository: goto `https://github.com/<username>/<repository_name>/settings/secrets/actions`, click `new repository secret`.

**Step 4**

1.  Create a workflow file, you need to create a file in following path: `.github/workflows/<some-name-you-like>.yml`, its important to have `.yml` extension and have exact same path.
2.  Following action file is complete enough to publish `gh-pages`, every time a new commit is merged in master branch. ‚úÖ

        name: gh-pages publisher üöÄ

        on:
        push:
          branches: [ master ]

        jobs:
        publish-gh-pages:
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
             - uses: actions/checkout@v2
             - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
             with:
                node-version: 12
             - run: npm ci
             - run: git config user.name "<user name>" && git config user.email "user email"
             - run: npm run deploy
             env:
                GH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.SECRET_GITHUB_TOKEN}}

This script is pretty self-explanatory, it performs the following tasks.

-   It specifies to work only on `push` on `master`
-   Sets up a `node 12` environment
-   Installs dependencies via `npm ci`
-   Sets up git requirements for username and email (required to do a push to branch)
-   Run the deploy script
-   In case you don‚Äôt use gh-pages npm package, you can write another step for git push to gh-pages branch.
-   At last, we set up env variable `GH_TOKEN` from our action secret (which you set up in step 3), this env variable would be available in `package.json`

**Step 5**

Commit this file and see your first `action` in action (sorry for the pun üôà)

Hope this helps üôèüôèüôè

-   You can see the actions running here: `https://github.com/<username>/<repository_name>/actions`.
